# FISH-FRESHNESS-DETECTION-USING-LOW-COST-IOT-HARDWARE
Low-cost IoT hardware (ESP32, MQ135, and TDS sensors) and machine learning models (Decision Trees, k-NN, and SVM) are used in this real-time fish spoilage detection system. The system classifies fish freshness by analyzing water quality, COâ‚‚, and ammonia. The results are shown on an intuitive dashboard.
